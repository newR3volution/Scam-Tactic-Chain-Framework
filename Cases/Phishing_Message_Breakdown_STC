Scam Breakdown – “TEMU Merchant Job Offer”

Phase 1: Disruption

Red Flags:
	•	Unexpected contact via iMessage from a Russian email address (rambler.ru domain) instead of a U.S. business.
	•	Too-good-to-be-true offer: Claims of $201–$3000 per day with “free training” and “same-day payment.”
	•	Fake job framing: “TEMU product review” sounds vaguely legitimate but is not a known recruitment path.

This phase is meant to catch attention, spark curiosity, and generate a reaction before logic kicks in.

⸻

Phase 2: Control

Red Flags:
	•	Claims to be from a company (“DSL”) with no verification or website provided.
	•	Uses vague corporate language (“recruitment platforms,” “flexible opportunity”) to sound official without proving legitimacy.
	•	Provides a WhatsApp number as the point of contact instead of a professional email or application portal—common for off-platform isolation.
	•	Mentions age eligibility (21+) to create false legitimacy and lower defenses by implying professionalism or compliance with regulation.
	• Claims payment is daily right after saying payment would come after work is complete

Control is established by presenting authority (a recruiter) and isolating the victim onto an encrypted private channel.

Phase 3: Compliance

Predicted Tactics:
If the victim follows through on contacting the WhatsApp number:
	•	They may be asked to send personal info (name, age, bank details).
	•	They could be lured into making an upfront “processing” payment or coerced into fake training tasks that involve purchasing items or giving away credentials.

Red Flags (anticipated):
	•	Request for personal financial information.
	•	High-pressure tactics or instructions not to tell anyone.
	•	Shifting goalposts (“You need to buy one product first to activate your account”).

⸻

Phase 4: Aftermath

Possible Outcomes:
	•	The scammer may disappear after data/money is received.
	•	Or they may pivot: offering “advanced roles,” “bonuses,” or refund fraud follow-ups.
	•	Victim data may be sold and used by other scam groups.

Red Flags (anticipated):
	•	Being contacted again for “refunds” or “bonus payments.”
	•	More pressure to buy gift cards or share login credentials.
