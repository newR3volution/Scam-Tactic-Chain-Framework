# Scam Tactic Chain™️ (STC)

A step-by-step breakdown of how modern scams operate. This framework helps identify where a scam tactic sits within the larger manipulation flow and what red flags to watch for at each phase.

---

## 1. Initial Lure
**Purpose:** Capture attention and spark curiosity or fear.  
**Examples:** Fake delivery notices, job offers, IRS warnings, sweepstakes messages.  
**Red Flags:** Vague language, urgency, no personalization, emotional triggers.

---

## 2. Trust Hook
**Purpose:** Build credibility by impersonating trusted institutions or using emotional manipulation.  
**Examples:** Use of logos, “official” tone, impersonating companies like FedEx, banks, or recruiters.  
**Red Flags:** Generic branding, overly formal language, mismatched contact info or visual cues.

---

## 3. Engagement Trigger
**Purpose:** Force or encourage the target to take immediate action.  
**Examples:** “Click the link,” “Reply with Y,” “Call this number,” “Download this document.”  
**Red Flags:** Unusual user instructions, strange technical workarounds, urgency-based prompts.

---

## 4. Payload Delivery
**Purpose:** Transition the user into the attacker’s control—via website, app, form, or malware.  
**Examples:** Phishing websites, fake portals, infected attachments, spoofed apps.  
**Red Flags:** Suspicious URLs (e.g., .cyou, .click), fake login pages, mismatched domains.

---

## 5. Data Extraction
**Purpose:** Harvest sensitive info such as login credentials, payment data, or identity documents.  
**Examples:** Fake shipping forms, credential harvesters, payment prompts, SSN or ID requests.  
**Red Flags:** Requests for personal/banking data, typos on form pages, no HTTPS.

---

## 6. Exploitation
**Purpose:** Use the stolen data for financial gain or access.  
**Examples:** Account takeover, unauthorized purchases, gift card fraud, wire transfers.  
**Red Flags:** Sudden account activity, password reset attempts, unauthorized charges.

---

## 7. Post-Exploitation Manipulation *(Optional)*  
**Purpose:** Extend the scam’s life cycle through continued grooming, threats, or further scams.  
**Examples:** Fake tech support calls, follow-up phishing, blackmail, romance grooming.  
**Red Flags:** Repeat contact, threats of arrest or exposure, pressure to act quickly again.

---

**Note:** Not all scams use every phase, but most use at least 4–5. Identifying the *phase* helps victims understand what’s happening and take targeted action to break the chain.p
