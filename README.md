## Overview

The Scam Tactic Chain (STC) is a streamlined framework for understanding how scams unfold. Instead of focusing on isolated red flags, it maps the **flow** of manipulation into four recognizable phases. This structure can be used to teach, analyze, and defend against social scams across text, email, job boards, and messaging platforms.

## The Four STC Phases

### 1. Disruption  
**Objective:** Capture attention and break the target’s routine.  
**Examples:**  
- Unsolicited job offers  
- Suspicious alerts or password reset messages for things you are not logging into (like Google telling you to change your Netflix password)  
- Fake promotions or prize notifications to things you have not entered

---

### 2. Control  
**Objective:** Shift influence to the scammer and suppress second-guessing.  
**Examples:**  
- Claims of authority or urgency  
- Requests to keep the conversation private  
- Emotional pressure like they may lose their job if you do not help or they love you so you should do this for them

---

### 3. Compliance  
**Objective:** Get the victim to act.  
**Examples:**  
- Sending money or gift cards or a cryptocurrency 
- Sharing login credentials or SSN or ID  
- Downloading a file or app

---

### 4. Aftermath  
**Objective:** Conclude, escalate, or restart the cycle.  
**Examples:**  
- The scammer vanishes with funds or account takeover occurs  
- Victim is contacted again for a “refund” or new opportunity/need  
- Victim info is sold and reused in other scams

## Case Example: “TEMU Product Review Job” Scam

**Message Text (excerpt):**  
> "We came across your profile... offering a flexible part-time opportunity... daily salary ranges from $201 to $3000... contact us via WhatsApp..."

**Sender Email:** `tnqcadznru@rambler.ru`

--This is an actual phish text message I received for a job offer that promised daily commission of $201-$3000
--Led to a whatsapp number to "get started" and came from an email domain in Russia.

### STC Breakdown

| Phase       | Behavior or Trigger                                                               | Red Flags                                                                                      |
|-------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Disruption  | Cold contact via iMessage with high-paying job claim                              | .ru email, vague recruiter identity, exaggerated salary claims                                |
| Control     | Urged to contact via WhatsApp and given artificial eligibility rules              | No website, unverifiable company (DSL), private communication channel                        |
| Compliance  | Victim expected to take action (predicted: send info, complete tasks, send funds) | Payment requests, identity submission, fake training or merchant platforms                   |
| Aftermath   | Scammer may disappear or extend scam via a fake refund or “next phase”            | Ghosting, recycled contact, future targeting or fake bonuses                                |
